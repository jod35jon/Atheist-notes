# The problem of evil
In simple terms, the problem arises from the fact that God is almighty, perfectly good and evil still exists.


# The problem
An important statement of the problem was attributed tto the philosopher **Epicurus**.
    Is God willing to prevent evil, but not willing? then is he impotent. Is he able but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is both able and willing? whence then is evil?

The problem of evil is a very important argument for atheism. If God exists, trhen he is omnipotent (all powerful) and perfectly good (omnibenevolent); a perfectly good being would eliminate evil as far as it could; there is no limit to what an omnipotent being can do; therefore, if God exists, there would be no evil in trhe word; There is evil in trhe word; therefore God does not exist. 


The problem of evil encompasses both moral evil (the is caused by human free will) and and natural evil  (that which is caused by natural phenomena such as disease, earthquakes and floods)

What would you change about the world we currently live in and how come that is really hard to be done by the all powerful and all loving God?

When we look at the world we live in, we can see a distiction between evil and sufferiing in the world and God. How is the world we live in different from that where God does not exist?

Could it really be possible that God is being hindered from intervening in this world we live in? Why does God have to play favorites?  Why can't we test his workings in the world we live in?

One popular Christian apologetic is one of God knowing good better than we do and therefore understands why the world is the way it is so that we have to get the consequesnces of those evil actions. 

The problem of evil leaves someone doubting the existence of God becuase it makes one's view of God inconsistent.
