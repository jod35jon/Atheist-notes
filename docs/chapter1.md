# Why I Became an Atheist: The Problem of Evil

The script for this is [here](./scripts/problem-of-evil.md)

## I. Introduction
- Brief personal background as a former believer
- Teaser: How the problem of evil led to atheism

## II. The Problem of Evil Explained
- Definition: All-powerful, all-knowing, perfectly good God
- Logical conflict:
  1. If God is omnipotent, He can prevent all evil
  2. If God is omniscient, He knows all evil
  3. If God is omnibenevolent, He wants to eliminate evil
  4. Evil exists in the world
  5. These points seem incompatible

## III. My Journey of Doubt
- Initial questions about suffering
  - Why do innocent children suffer from diseases?
  - Why do natural disasters devastate communities?
- Attempted reconciliations
  - Free will argument
  - "God's plan" perspective

## IV. Deeper Analysis
- The world as it is vs. how it could be
  - What would I change if I were all-powerful?
    - Eliminate childhood cancer
    - Stop tsunamis
    - Prevent genocides
  - Why couldn't an omnipotent God make these changes?
- Indistinguishability from a godless world
  - Natural laws operate without apparent divine intervention
  - Good people suffer while some who do evil prosper
  - No clear evidence of divine justice or protection

## V. Challenging Common Apologetics
- "God is hindered from intervening"
  - Contradicts the concept of an all-powerful deity
- "God plays favorites"
  - Why save one child but not another?
- "God knows better than we do"
  - If God is omnipotent, couldn't He achieve His purposes without extreme suffering?

## VI. The Shift to Atheism
- Removing God from the equation made the world make more sense
- Suffering as a result of natural processes and human actions
- An indifferent universe vs. divine plan

## VII. Reasons for Atheism
- Inconsistency with a benevolent deity
- Moral autonomy without need to reconcile God with suffering
- Free will defense insufficient for natural evils
- Logical incompatibility of perfect God and world full of evil

## VIII. Conclusion
- The problem of evil as a significant factor in journey to atheism
- Invitation for viewers to share their thoughts
- Call to action (like, subscribe, comment)
